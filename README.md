### Gameplay

While you are playing the game, you will be shown the current board representation where 'BOX' represents the box, 'ROCK' represents a rock,
'PLANT' represents a plant, and 'NONE' represents an empty tile on the board. Your current score will be displayed as well. Also, you will be 
asked which direction you want to move the box to. If the box moves towards a plant or a plant moves towards the box, the box will eat it and 
you will gain one point. Else if the box collides a rock (i.e. being on the same tile as a rock), the game is over.
